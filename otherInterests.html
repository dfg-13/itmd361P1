      <h1>Other Interests I Have</h1>
      <p>
        For the sake of keeping it short in case you don't want to read or
        scroll. I am into video games often playing Dota 2 or messing around in
        racing simulators. I am also into a somewhat "niche" genre of electronic
        music.

          <h3>Dota 2</h3>
          <p>
            As far as video games go, I really only stick to Dota 2 and like two
            or three racing simulator titles. Five years ago, I probably had
            more games to play, but as time went on I just grew bored of other
            titles or I just realized I would rather put time on the titles I
            truly enjoy.
          </p>

          <p>
            First up, I am very into <i>Dota 2</i>. It is a MOBA competitive
            esport title. The main objective of the game is to destroy the other
            teams "ancient" which is a special type of building. Games can vary
            in length with some going as short as 25-minutes with others going
            as long as 1.5 hours. Although the long games are rare, they do
            happen.

          </figure>

          <p>
            I have about just a little less than 4,000 hours on the game. I
            started playing the game back in 2015, and it wasn't until the
            1000th hour that I started gettng better. I mainly play as a
            "position 4" (soft support) which is the support to the offlaner
            hero. I also rotate between a few heroes which are Ancient
            Apparition, Lich, and Phoenix.

          <h3>Racing Simulators</h3>
          <p>
            Aside from playing a competitive title like <i>Dota 2</i> which can
            be mentally exhausting at times. I also enjoy playing around in
            racing simulators such as <i>Assetto Corsa</i>,
            <i>Assetto Corsa Competitizione</i>, and <i>Automobilista 2</i>. I
            also like other titles, but these three I just spend the most time
            on.

          <p>
            What appeals the most to me about racing simulators is feeling the
            how different cars from different disciplines of racing react to
            different tracks as well as modifying certain parts of a setup like
            a car's suspension or aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, I love
            reading into data and statistics, and the fact that these simulators
            extract data from telemetry also make it more realistic since real
            physics are implemented into these simulators.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <h3>Hard Dance</h3>
        <p>
          I am very big into a "niche" music genre known as Hardstyle and
          Hardcore. It is very unknown in the United States, but it is big in
          Europe, mostly in Holland. The genre is basically a song that is in a
          tempo from 150BPM to 200BPM with a kick that commonly sounds like
          <i><strong>BONG</strong></i
          >.

            >Here is an example of the genre with music that covers 15 years of
            Hardstyle music.</a

        </p>
        <h3>Vocal Trance</h3>
        <p>
          I also enjoy trance, but on the condition that it has vocals. I mainly
          listen to this to chill or sometimes when I'm coding, but mostly when
          I'm commuting.
