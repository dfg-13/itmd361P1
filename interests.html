        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>To make it brief before specifically listing my interests, I could say that I am into sports, video games, and lifting.</p>
        <h2>Sports that I like</h2>
        <p>I enjoy keeping up and watching Formula 1. I didn't actually develop an interest in this up until the end of the 2019 season. What sparked an interest was actually messing with racing simulators and using Formula-1 spec cars. Gaining a perspective of what the drivers do via simulator allowed me to gain an initial understanding of what drivers have to do and endure during a race.</p>
        <p>I am a <b>big</b> Fernando Alonso fan. I find that his cheeky and troll-like mannerisms to be very amusing. From blackmailing the Ron Dennis (Mclaren CEO) in 2007 to having angry radio communications during his second Mclaren stint. I would regard him as the GOAT mainly because he has been performing at a high level for 20 consistent years from 2001 to present day.</p>
        <p>Here is one of my favorite compilation video of Fernando Alonso's top radio moments:</p>

        <p>In terms of best looking car (or one of the good ones as I like many different ones from different eras), for me that would have to be the Eagle Mk1.</p>

        <p>Here's another car/livery combination just for the fun of it. It is the Jaguar R2 that competed in the 2001 season. I personally like the green and the giant Jaguar logo. Sadly, the car wasn't as good as it looked.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy watching other forms of motorsport like the IMSA series or LeMans Prototype class in the endurance series.</p>
