      <h1>Motorsport Interest</h1>
      <p id="summary">
        To make it brief and short, I am very into Formula 1 with Fernando
        Alonso being my favorite driver of all time. I also enjoy the historic
        cars and tracks.

            I enjoy keeping up and watching Formula 1. I didn't actually develop
            an interest in this up until the end of the 2019 season. What
            sparked an interest was actually messing with racing simulators and
            using Formula-1 spec cars. Gaining a perspective of what the drivers
            do via simulator allowed me to gain an initial understanding of what
            drivers have to do and endure during a race.

            I am a <strong>big</strong> Fernando Alonso fan. I find that his
            cheeky and troll-like mannerisms to be very amusing. From
            blackmailing the Ron Dennis (Mclaren CEO) in 2007 to having angry
            radio communications during his second Mclaren stint. I would regard
            him as the GOAT mainly because he has been performing at a high
            level for 20 consistent years from 2001 to present day.
          </p>

            Here is one of my favorite compilation video of Fernando Alonso's
            top radio moments:

          In terms of best looking car (or one of the good ones as I like many
          different ones from different eras), for me that would have to be the
          Eagle Mk1.

          <p>
            Here's another car/livery combination just for the fun of it. It is
            the Jaguar R2 that competed in the 2001 season. I personally like the
            green and the giant Jaguar logo. Sadly, the car wasn't as good as it
            looked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy watching other forms of motorsport like the IMSA series
            or LeMans Prototype class in the endurance series.

          Even though I wasn't into motorsport back then, let alone know about
          it, I wish that the machinery from 30 years ago would come out of
          muesuems and go into active racing. For example, take the 1989
          Mercedes C9. Minimalist design and a very "muscle-y" sound.
